# Paddy Scheduler

This is the CRON scheduling component for Paddy, the Power Administration Daemon.

It uses [Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework](https://quarkus.io/) running Java 17, is written in Kotlin, and is deployed in Docker.

The job of this application is to load & manage CRON tasks for each Paddy Daemon.
